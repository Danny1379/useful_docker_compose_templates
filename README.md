# useful_docker_compose_templates
I forget how to do stuff so i'm putting this here so i can use this for common tasks i tend to do.
Feel free to give me pointers and stuff as well and if you feel what you see here is useful feel free to use it.
If you find any of the templates to be bad(like insecure or anything) i would love to know and improve upon them.
I tend to answer stuff with a delay so i would recommend emailing me as well so i get back to you. 
Happy Coding.
